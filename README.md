# Flip2BeRAD
A suite of Python scripts for flipping RADseq reads

Right now I am brushing up on my Python skills and will be evolving this project as I go. 

There are two main goals: 
First, I will be converting the flip script that was written in Perl into Python.
Second, I'll be adding additional functionality to incorporate new features (like, a user-given rad site(s), mismatch acceptance, etc.).
